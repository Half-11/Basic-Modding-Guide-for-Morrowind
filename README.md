# Basic Modding Guide for Morrowind

## About this guide
This guide aims to help (new) players to improve the game of Morrowind by giving a step-by-step explanation on how to install the most essential mods.

## Before we begin


download the required software
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555

Update to DirectX 9.0c June 2010. (This is a required update for all Windows, and won't conflict with DX10+.)

* [Register on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/signup) - Most mods in this guide will be downloaded from Nexus. Nexus Mods is a site which allows users to upload and download "mods" (modifications) for computer games like Morrowind. In order to do this you have to create account. Click on the REGISTER NOW button to start your registration. The next screen will ask you to select a membership. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THIS! Just go to the bottom and select "create account" without selecting any. The rest is self-explanatory

* [Download and install 7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) - If you haven't a file archiver installed on your computer I would recommened installing one. All mods on Nexus will be downloaded as one archive file (.7z/.rar/.zip files). 7-Zip is one of the best-known utilities for unpacking such archives into their orginal state.
