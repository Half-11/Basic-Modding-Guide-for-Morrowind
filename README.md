# Basic Modding Guide for Morrowind

## About this guide
This guide aims to help (new) players to improve the game of Morrowind by giving a step-by-step explanation on how to install the most essential mods.

## 1. Before we begin
Before we start installing mods we need to create an account and install some required software.

* [Register on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/signup) - Most mods in this guide will be downloaded from Nexus. Nexus Mods is a site which allows users to upload and download "mods" (modifications) for computer games like Morrowind. In order to do this you have to create account. Click on the REGISTER NOW button to start your registration. The next screen will ask you to select a paid membership. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THIS! Just go to the bottom and select "create account" without selecting any membership. The rest is self-explanatory

* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) - If you haven't a file archiver installed on your computer I would recommened installing one. All mods on Nexus will be downloaded as one archive file (.7z/.rar/.zip files). 7-Zip is one of the best-known utilities for unpacking such archives into their orginal state.

* [DirectX 9.0c June 2010](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) - This is a required update for third-party software we are going to use and won't conflict with exisiting installations of DirectX (10+).

* [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) - This is another requirement for third-party software later in this guide.

## 2. Propper Game Installation
- Don't install Morrowind in its default folder (C:\Program Files). This folder is monitored by the security system, which was unknown at the time of Morrowind's design. Because of this, the default installation location can lead to crashes, error messages and mods not appearing. Instead, it is strongly recommended to create a new folder on your hard drive, such as: C:\Games\Morrowind.

- Make sure you are running the latest official patch (v1.6.1820). Steam, GOG and Bethesda Launcher versions of the game are up to date. If you are running the CD version of the game, the correct installation order is: Morrowind / Tribunal / Bloodmoon / Bloodmoon Patch v1.6.1820 (skip Morrowind Patch v1.2.0722 and Tribunal Patch v1.4.1313).
     - When you are in doubt about the version of your game; this can be found at the bottom left of the main menu of the game.

- Steam users whould follow [this short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV1UbXLTsy0) to change the games installation path.

*For Steam users: follow this short tutorial to change the games installation path.


Morrowinds installation comes with lots of unnecessary files that only get in the way. You can safely remove these unnecessary files, so you have a nice clean installation.

You can now make a backup of the installation folder for later use. You don't actually need to install the game to install it again on a different computer. You can just drag and drop the folder and it will work just fine.
